### Homework 1: [Controlling an RGB LED](/Lab2)
In this project the brightness of each color of an RGB LED is controlled using potentiometers.

### Homework 2: [Simulating the traffic lights of a crosswalk](/Lab3)
In this project multiple states are used to simulate the traffic light of a crosswalk. There is one for the pedestrians (using a green and a red LEDs) 
and one for the cars (using a green, a yellow and a red LEDs).
